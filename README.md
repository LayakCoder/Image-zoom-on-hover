# Image Zoom on Hover - CSS Hover Effect

## Introduction

Welcome to the [**Image Zoom on Hover**](https://layakcoder.com/image-zoom-on-hover/) project! In this project, we demonstrate an elegant and interactive image hover effect where images expand and display additional details like the image name and skills upon hovering. This effect is built using **HTML** and **CSS**. It's simple yet visually appealing and perfect for showcasing content with smooth transitions.

### Key Features:
- **Hover Zoom Effect**: The image zooms in when the user hovers over it, creating a dynamic visual experience.
- **Details on Hover**: Along with the zoom, additional details like the name of the image and skills appear with a smooth transition.
- **Responsive Layout**: The images are displayed in a row and adjust accordingly when hovered.

This effect can be used to showcase images with detailed information or as part of a portfolio or product gallery on websites.

## How It Works
### HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language)
In the **HTML** structure, we define the layout of the image gallery. We create a parent `<div>` element to contain multiple child `<div>` elements, each representing an image and its respective details like the title and skills. 

### CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
We apply CSS to create the hover zoom effect:
- The images are initially displayed with a smaller width and more height.
- When a user hovers over an image, its width increases, revealing details like the image name and related skills.
- Smooth transition effects are used to create a pleasant experience.
